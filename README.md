Apache Maven Indexer (evr-fork)
====================

This is a fork of the Apache Maven Indexer:
http://maven.apache.org/maven-indexer/

The aim of this fork is to integrate an updated Lucene version, supporting
compressed indices and higher performance.

Since Lucene 4.x is used, backwards compatibility with legacy Maven indices is broken.
(The .zip download). Old format shouldn't be used anyway.
